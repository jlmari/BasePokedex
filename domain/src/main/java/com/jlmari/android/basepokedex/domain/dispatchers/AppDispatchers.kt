/**
 * Defines the dispatchers available to use to handle the thread pools of the coroutines.
 *
 * @property main       Main dispatcher that uses the UI thread of Android.
 * @property io         Dispatcher that uses a shared pool of on-demand created threads and is
 *                      designed for offloading of IO-intensive blocking operations.
 * @property default    This dispatcher is used to run tasks that make intensive use of the CPU
 *                      (App computations, algorithms, etc). It can use as many threads as
 *                      CPU cores.
 * @property unconfined This dispatcher starts a coroutine in the caller thread, but only until
 *                      the first suspension point. After suspension the coroutine resumes in
 *                      whatever thread that is used by the corresponding suspending function,
 *                      without confining it to any specific thread or pool. SHOULD NOT BE USED
 *                      IN PRODUCTION CODE.
