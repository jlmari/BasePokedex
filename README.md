# Base Pokedex
Base Pokedex Project is created with the only purpose to be the reference for the future projects being developed easily. Its purpose is to create an app with the sufficient level of quality, pretty robust and easy-to-read in order to achieve our goal ASAP.

Currently, following the last trends in the Android Development scenario, this app is mainly developed with [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin), by using [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) following [Clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) best practices and [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles.
